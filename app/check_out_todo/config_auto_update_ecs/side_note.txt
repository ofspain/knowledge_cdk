Architecture Diagram

Dev uploads new config.json --> S3 Bucket
            |
            | (S3 triggers Lambda function)
            v
Lambda reads config and secrets
            |
            | (registers new ECS task definition revision)
            v
   Lambda updates ECS Service
            |
            | (force new deployment)
            v
   ECS tasks restart with new environment!



âœ¨ After Deploying This Stack:
A brand new S3 bucket will exist (e.g., configupdatestack-configbucket...)

Lambda is automatically triggered when a new config.json is uploaded.

Lambda reads the file, updates ECS Task Definition, triggers service deployment.

No manual ECS update needed anymore!

âœ¨ Bonus (Optional Enhancements Later)
Add CloudWatch Alarms if Lambda fails.

Set bucket notification filters (e.g., only react to *.json files).

Use Parameter Store to store env variables cleanly instead of hardcoding them.

Add a backup plan for the config bucket (cross-region backup).



ðŸš€ Next level enhancement?

A simple CDK stack to deploy the Lambda + S3 + permissions.

A CloudWatch rule to monitor failures of config deployments.
